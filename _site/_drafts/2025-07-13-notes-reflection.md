# Reflection on my life (To be continued)


## Before College 
I was born in Harbin, a small city in the northeastern part of China. The city has a very poor education system compared to the rest of the country. I realized this after I entered university and started making friends from different places. When I talked with them about their teachers, I saw how big the gap was between my hometown and major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou. For example, some of their teachers graduated from Harvard, while my English teacher had never left my hometown in her life. Not to complainâ€”on the contrary, I am grateful. It makes me treasure my current life even more.

My grades are pretty mediocre because my parents are not asking for good grades and i am not into the subjects that the school is teaching. Some of the topics are like old people words and some made-up stories to tell students to love the country. After many years i realized that's a part of brainwashing, i don't think that's a china issue since all the countries are doing that to some extent by twisting the histories and facts a little bit towards the story that is beneficial to the exisitng government. Some great schoars are behind it so that the students can't find logcial flaws easily(but there are indeed). In my childhood, my favorite thing is computer games. I play Dungeon Fighter, some roleplaying old Chinese culture game and league of legends(starting from season 2). I watched a lot of animes at that time. Probably because i spent too much time on my computer. When I know i have to prepare for Gaokao, i just looked at the computer science major rankings in China and picked a top3 school as my target. My grades was like 100 scores away from it. 

## My stupidity on research
I don't understand research in my early life in college. I think the major reason is i read so little and the text is not arrousng interst from me. My family don't have a habit of reading and the school is not designing a good strategy to help students grow reading habits. Probably call back to the previous topic, my teachers are not very literate either. I found i have a good skill is to pick who to follow and imitate. In my early age, i find i have good skill on learn from others. In general people natually learn from others. But often i see people struggling find the right target.
